# GlazeWM Configuration

This repository holds my configuration files for [GlazeWM](https://glazewm.org/), a tiling window manager for Windows, set up to enhance window organization and multitasking.

## Features

- **Window Tiling**: Automatic and custom window tiling setups for an organized workspace.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Custom shortcuts for quick window management.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ka1Thakkar/glazewm-config.git
  
2. Copy the configuration files into your GlazeWM config directory (typically found in ```C:\Users\YourUsername\.glzr\glazewm\```).
3. Restart GlazeWM to apply the new configuration.


You can save this markdown text as `README.md` in your GlazeWM configuration repository.
